Project Description
This is the "Recipes" project, the very first practical assignment from The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum.

The core goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website using pure HTML. The website consists of a main index page that acts as the homepage and provides links to several individual recipe pages.

This project serves to demonstrate my foundational proficiency in structuring web content and creating navigable links between different pages.

Demonstrated Skills
By completing this project, I have showcased the following basic HTML skills and concepts:

Basic HTML Document Structure: Using the essential boilerplate (<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>).

Heading Hierarchy: Utilizing <h1> for the main title and other headings to structure content clearly.

Working with Text: Including paragraphs (<p>) and line breaks.

Lists: Creating ordered lists (<ol>) for step-by-step cooking instructions and unordered lists (<ul>) for ingredient lists.

Links and Navigation:

Creating internal links (<a> with href attributes) to connect the index page to the recipe pages.

Setting up navigation links back to the homepage on each recipe page (using relative pathing, e.g., ../index.html).

File Organization: Utilizing a simple directory structure with a dedicated folder for recipe pages (/recipes).

Image Inclusion: Embedding images (<img>) to make the pages more visually appealing.

Site Structure
The website follows this page and file structure:

Main Page: index.html

Link to [Recipe 1]

Link to [Recipe 2]

Link to [Recipe 3]

Recipe Pages:

recipes/[recipe-1].html

recipes/[recipe-2].html

recipes/[recipe-3].html
